# HuMicA
The Human Microglia Atlas (HuMicA) is an integrated snRNA-seq object encompassing immune cells from sixteen brain tissue datasets across multiple neurodegenerative conditions, including patients diagnosed with AlzheimerÂ´s Disease, Autism Spectrum Disorder, epilepsy, COVID-19, Lewy Body Diseases, Multiple Sclerosis, and individuals without known neuropathology. It encompasses eleven transcriptionally distinct microglia subpopulations, including homeostatic as well as "disease-associated microglia" (DAM) and "disease-inflammatory macrophages" (DIMs).
