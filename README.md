# HuMicA (Human Microglia Atlas)

The Human Microglia Atlas (HuMicA) is an integrated single-cell (sc) and single nucleus (sn)RNA-seq object encompassing immune cells from nineteen brain tissue datasets across multiple neurodegenerative conditions, including patients diagnosed with AlzheimerÂ´s Disease, Autism Spectrum Disorder, epilepsy, COVID-19, Lewy Body Diseases, Multiple Sclerosis, and individuals without known neuropathology. It encompasses 90,716 nuclei/cells and nine transcriptomically distinct microglia subpopulations. A ShinyCell interactive web app is available at https://in7yqx-ricardo-ferreira.shinyapps.io/shinyapp/.
